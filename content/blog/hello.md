This is one more in a long line of blogs set up by me. Seems I have one from every stage in my life. I had a movies and book review blog back in the early 2000s, then my Ruby focussed blog at http://svs.io, then [a medium site](https://medium.com/@_svs_), poorly maintained and sporadically updated and now this - something minimal with Hugo, blogging in emacs and publishing with a git push.

Here I'll mainly be writing about my learnings in digital product development and managing teams of highly skilled hackers.
